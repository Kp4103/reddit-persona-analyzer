## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Reddit API credentials (free)
- 4GB+ RAM (for AI models)
- Internet connection

## ‚ö° Quick Start (One-Click Setup)

**For evaluators:** Run this single command for automated setup:

```bash
python setup.py
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Check Python version compatibility
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies automatically
- ‚úÖ Create configuration template
- ‚úÖ Provide clear Reddit API setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Test the installation

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd reddit-persona-analyzer
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Reddit API Setup (Free)

1. Go to [Reddit App Preferences](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/)
2. Click "Create App" or "Create Another App"
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: PersonaAnalyzer (or any name)
   - **App Type**: Select "script"
   - **Description**: Reddit persona analysis tool
   - **About URL**: Leave blank
   - **Redirect URI**: http://localhost:8080
4. Click "Create app"
5. Note down your credentials:
   - **Client ID**: Found under the app name (short string)
   - **Client Secret**: The longer "secret" string

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your Reddit credentials:

REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=PersonaAnalyzer/1.0 by YourRedditUsername
```

**Alternative**: You can also edit the credentials directly in `main.py` (lines 330-332).

## üéØ Usage

### Testing GPU Performance (Optional)
```bash
python test_gpu.py
```

This will show you:
- Available GPU devices and memory
- Model loading performance comparison  
- Expected speedup from GPU acceleration

### Enhanced Version with Rich Behavioral Insights
```bash
python main_enhanced.py https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py https://www.reddit.com/user/kojied/
```

### With Custom Limit
```bash
python main.py https://www.reddit.com/user/Hungry-Move-6603/ --limit 150
```

### Supported URL Formats
- `https://www.reddit.com/user/username/`
- `https://www.reddit.com/u/username/`
- `reddit.com/user/username`
- Just the username: `username`

## üìä Output

The script generates a professional persona file named `{username}_persona.txt` containing:

- **Demographics & Overview**: Activity patterns, primary communities
- **Personality Traits**: AI-analyzed characteristics with confidence levels
- **Interests & Activities**: Categorized interests from content analysis
- **Representative Quote**: Authentic statement from user's content
- **Activity Analysis**: Community engagement patterns
- **Data Sources & Citations**: Links to all analyzed content

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **RedditScraper**: Handles API interactions and data collection
2. **PersonaAnalyzer**: AI-powered analysis using free Hugging Face models
3. **PersonaGenerator**: Formats professional persona output

### AI Models Used (All Free)

- **FLAN-T5-Large**: Text generation and analysis
- **RoBERTa**: Sentiment analysis for personality insights
- **BART-Large-MNLI**: Zero-shot classification for interests

### Rate Limiting

- Respects Reddit's API limits (60 requests/minute)
- Built-in delays between requests
- Graceful handling of API errors

## üìù Sample Output Files

The repository includes sample outputs for the required test users:
- `kojied_persona.txt`
- `Hungry-Move-6603_persona.txt`

## üîß Technical Details

### Free Model Strategy
The analyzer uses a tiered approach for cost-free AI analysis:

1. **Primary**: Hugging Face Transformers (local inference)
2. **Fallback**: Smaller models if memory constraints
3. **Hybrid**: Combines AI insights with keyword-based analysis

### Error Handling
- Handles deleted/private content gracefully
- Manages API rate limits automatically
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Continues analysis even if some requests fail

### Citation System
Every persona characteristic includes:
- Direct links to supporting Reddit posts/comments
- Confidence levels for AI-generated insights
- Source post metadata (score, subreddit, type)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Reddit API Errors**
- Verify your credentials are correct
- Ensure the user profile is public
- Check your internet connection

**2. Model Loading Issues**
- Free up RAM (models require 2-4GB)
- Close other applications
- Use the smaller fallback models

**3. No Content Found**
- User might have deleted posts
- Account could be private/suspended
- Try a different user profile

**4. Slow Performance**
- AI models take time to load initially
- Subsequent analyses are faster
- Consider reducing the `--limit` parameter

### Debug Mode
For detailed logging, modify the logging level in `main.py`:
```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
